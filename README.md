Please list two areas of the assignment you'd like to **discuss further with your peers** during the next class (examples include better ways to implement something, how to extend your app in certain ways, etc):

1. Finding a better way to query for ParseObjects
2. Setting up an improved way of sending information between previous activity or fragment

## Notes

The biggest challenge that I'd come across had to do with making sense of queries and relationships between objects in Parse to the point where I could actively apply it to my own custom Parse classes.
